                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p><img src="images/selfie.jpg" alt="photo" class="alignleft">My name is Courina Camp, and I'm a Digital Media Student currently working on three associates degrees in Digital Media, Illustration and Graphic Design.&nbsp; </p>
                <p>I have always been a creative type, often drawing and crafting when everyone else was playing outside, much to my parents chagrin. As an adult my love for creativity has not faded so I have decided to pursue a career where I can utilize it.&nbsp; </p>
                <p>My long term goal is to one day design book covers. I am an avid reader and despite the old saying "dont judge a book by it's cover" I totally do! There's been a few I almost skipped due to the cover that I ended up loving and I always wonder how many othes skipped it for the same reason. It would be incredible to be able to be a part of book sales in this way.</p>
